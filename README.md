At this stage, the model is a modified version of my original LLM, allowing for training and running to be performed separately.
To train, run train.py
To genertate, run generate.py


Plans for the model: Incorporate a more advanced tokenizer; Expand training data (maybe through the use of web scraping); Implement a fine-tuning system to turn it into a chatbot; set up messaging with the bot.
